### Built with

-  **Semantic HTML5**  
- **CSS custom properties**  
- **Flexbox**  
- **Mobile-first workflow**  


### What I learned

This project helped me practice using **flexbox** to center elements and work on a **mobile-first responsive design**. I also improved my understanding of **box shadows and border-radius** to enhance the UI aesthetics.  

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```


### Continued development

Going forward, I plan to:

Improve my CSS Grid skills for layout design.
Experiment with animations and hover effects for better UI interactivity.
Optimize for larger screen sizes with better spacing and layout considerations.
